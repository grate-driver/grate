## Overview

The Tegra fragment shader ISA is not as straight forward as [[Vertex Shader ISA]].

The fragment shader is separated into five different instruction streams:
* PSEQ - fetching data from the memory and feeding it to the pipeline as registers data or instructions
* MFU - multi-function unit, varying interpolate and special functions
* TEX - texture lookups
* ALU - arithmetic logic unit
* DW - writing to the output surface / buffers

The different units seems to be synchronized by separate timing streams.

#### Instructions flow

| Sequence: |   1  |  2  |  2  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  4  |  4  |  5 |
|----------:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:--:|
|  Stage 1: | PSEQ |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |    |
|  Stage 2: |      | MFU | MFU | MFU |     |     |     |     |    |
|  Stage 3: |      |     |     |     | TEX |     |     |     |    |
|  Stage 4: |      |     |     |     |     | ALU | ALU | ALU |    |
|  Stage 5: |      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | DW |

## Instructions scheduling

Patent: https://www.google.com/patents/US8856499

Instructions schedule specifies the number of MFU and ALU instructions executed by the respective stage, each from 1 to 3 per fragment pipeline instructions batch.

| Bits | Meaning                           |
|-----:|:----------------------------------|
| 2..7 | Address                           |
| 0..1 | Number of instructions to execute |

If the "number of instructions to execute" is 0, then the pipeline stage is NOP, however still takes 1 clock cycle. The "address" is the number of pushed instructions before the instruction to execute, so unit[Address] ... unit[Address + Number of instructions to execute] instructions will be executed, where unit stands for MFU or ALU.

## ALU instruction word encoding

The ALU instructions comes in packets of 3 or 4 scalar instructions (the fourth instruction can be traded for embedded constants). Each ALU instruction package seems to run pipelined, and each instruction in a package can use partial results from the previous instruction.

|   Bits | Meaning                  |
|-------:|:-------------------------|
| 62..63 | opcode                   |
|     61 | accumulate result: other |
|     60 | accumulate result: this  |
|     59 | addition disable         |
| 57..58 | scale result             |
|     56 | saturate result          |
| 54..55 | condition code           |
| 47..53 | destination register     |
|     46 | write high subregister   |
|     45 | write low subregister    |
| 32..44 | operand rA               |
| 19..31 | operand rB               |
|  6..18 | operand rC               |
|   0..5 | operand rD               |

#### ALU buffer and pixel packet:

Patent: https://www.google.com/patents/US7710427

#### ALU embedded constants:

Patent: https://www.google.com/patents/US8775777

Unlike a regular ALU instruction, the ALU3 instruction words, constituting immediate constants, shouldn't be swapped. Constant is either one fp20 or two fx10.

|   Bits | Meaning              |
|-------:|:---------------------|
| 44..63 | Immediate constant 2 |
| 24..43 | Immediate constant 1 |
|  4..23 | Immediate constant 0 |

#### Opcodes:

| opcode | Mnemonic | Meaning            | pseudo-code                |
|-------:|:--------:|:-------------------|:---------------------------|
|      0 |    MAD   | Multiply-Add       | rA * rB + rC * rD          |
|      1 |    MIN   | Minimum            | min(rA * rB, rC * rD)      |
|      2 |    MAX   | Maximum            | max(rA * rB, rC * rD)      |
|      3 |   CSEL   | Conditional select | (rA < 0) ? rB : (rC * rD)  |

#### Scale result:

| Value |  Meaning |
|------:|:---------|
|   0   | No scale |
|   1   |    x2    |
|   2   |    x4    |
|   3   |    / 2   |

#### Condition code:

The conditional operation is applied to the ALU's result, so the final result is either 0.0 (false) or 1.0 (true).

| Value | Meaning                  |
|------:|:-------------------------|
|     0 | no comparison            |
|     1 | zero                     |
|     2 | greater than zero        |
|     3 | greater or equal to zero |

#### Condition registers:

The condition register comprises two fixed10 values, 0.0 or 1.0. In order to write a value to the condition register, the destination register should be selected to the condition register 64..71. To write to the higher part of the condition register, "write high subregister" bit needs to be set; otherwise lower part will be written regardless of the "write low subregister" bit state.

    Condition register stored value = !!(ALU result)

#### Kill register:

Non-zero value written to the KILL register discards the fragment, zero keeps it alive and doesn't resurrect the killed fragment. Destination register write mask (low/high halves) is ignored.

#### Position registers:

The returned fragment position X register value is accumulated by 8192.0, fragment position Y value is negative and accumulated by 8192.0 plus the render target height - 1.

    pos.x = frag.x + 8192
    pos.y = 8192 + (target_height - 1) - frag.y

#### Operands (rA, rB, rC):

|  Bits | Meaning               |
|------:|:----------------------|
| 12..6 | register selector     |
|     5 | sub-register selector |
|     4 | fixed10 minus one     |
|     3 | fixed10               |
|     2 | absolute value        |
|     1 | negate                |
|     0 | scale by two          |

#### Operand rD:

|   Bits | Meaning                      |
|-------:|:-----------------------------|
|      5 | rD selector (0 = rB, 1 = rC) |
|      4 | sub-register selector        |
|      3 | fixed10 minus one            |
|      2 | enable rD (scale rC by rD)   |
|      1 | absolute value               |
|      0 | fixed10                      |

#### Registers:

|  Value | Meaning                   |
|-------:|:--------------------------|
|  0..15 | row registers             |
| 16..23 | general purpose registers |
| 24..27 | ALU result registers      |
| 28..30 | embedded constants        |
|     31 | lowp vec2(0, 1)           |
| 32..63 | uniform registers         |
| 64..71 | condition registers       |
|     72 | fragment x-position       |
|     73 | fragment y-position       |
|     75 | polygon face              |
|     76 | kill (discard) fragment   |

#### Result accumulation:

Patent: https://www.google.com/patents/US8521800

When "accumulate this" bit is set, operand rC is overridden with the accumulation value.

|       | Accumulate this | Accumulate other |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| ALU0: | ALU0 += ALU3    | No action        |
| ALU1: | ALU1 += ALU0    | ALU0 += ALU1     |
| ALU2: | ALU2 += ALU1    | ALU0 += ALU2     |
| ALU3: | ALU3 += ALU2    | ALU2 += ALU3     |

#### Addition disable

When bit "addition disable" is set, the Multiply-Add operation turns into two multiplies. The fx10 result of each multiply goes to the low/high subregisters of the destination register.

| write high subregister | write low subregister | destination low | destination high |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
|            1           |           0           |      rC*rD      |       rA*rB      |
|            0           |           1           |      rA*rB      |       rC*rD      |

## MFU instruction word encoding

The MFU unit can interpolate 4 component vectors per instruction and/or evaluate scalar special functions. Based on [this design](http://pctuning.tyden.cz/ilustrace3/soucek/g80/paper-164.pdf).
